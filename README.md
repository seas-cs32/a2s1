This directory contains everything you need as a student for Act II,
Scene I (Search).

The following files are used in **Problem #8 (Find a phrase)**:

`bf_strmatch*.py`: Two different Python implementations of a brute-force
algorithm for string matching.

`rk_strmatch.py`: A Python implementation of Rabin-Karp string matching.

`cmp_strmatch.py`: A script to compare the running times of our brute-force and
Rabin-Karp algorithms.  You might not want to wait until it finishes. The last
runs for brute-force can take a long time.


The following files are used in **Problem #9 (Build an index)**:

`simple_hash.py`: A simplified version of the hashing used in Rabin-Karp.  This
script contains both the `simple_hash` and `update_hash` functions.

`index*.py`: Scripts we use in building a book index using the Python dictionary
data type.


The following files are used in **Problem #10 (Driving directions)**:

`maze.py`: Definition of our Maze data type.  Run by itself, it runs some tests.

`city.py`: Definition of the CitySqGrid data type.  Run by itself, it runs some
tests.

`walk.py`: A simple script that allows us to direct a walk around a city.

`dogwalk.py`: An implementation of a self-avoiding random walk simulation.

`directions0.py`: A first start at actual driving directions.

`directions.py`: A depth-first-search (dfs) approach that produces driving directions.

`directions-bfs.py`: A breadth-first-search (bfs) approach that produces directions that take the shortest path from start to goal.
